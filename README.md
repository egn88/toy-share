# toy-share

# Problem

Currently, families and friends tend to share toys when their kids grow up and don't use them any more. Additionally, everyone tries to reuse toys as much as possible as their use is bounded to a very specific period of time (usually one or two years), and buying new toys is generally expensive and short lasting. 

# Solution

In light of the above, the main goal of this project is to facilitate a community driven toy sharing mechanism, in which everyone is able to share their no longer needed toys.

Every user shall share the toys either within specific user groups, or within the whole community.

The users shall provide their location in order to calculate shipping costs and help user decision making.

The toys shall be evaluated both by the provider and the recievers in order to ensure a fair use of the platform.
